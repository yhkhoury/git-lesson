# Git Lesson

This lesson covers the basics of using git for version control. 

This lesson is for the first day of the MSSE bootcamp. 

To make a commit (or "version" or "checkpoint") of your files, 
follow this procedure:

1. Make changes to your project
2. When you have your changes, tell git you are ready to create a commit by adding files to the staging area using "git add filename" 
3. Create a checkpoint ("commit") using 'git commint -m "message about what you want"
